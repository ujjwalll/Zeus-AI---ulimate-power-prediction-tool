The dataset is collected from one of the IIIT-Delhi buildings. 

This directory contains two CSV files namely building_occupancy.csv and building_power.csv. Occupancy and power files contain building’s occupancy count and power consumption at a sampling rate of one minute respectively.

Sub-directory ‘calendar’ contains three CSV files corresponding to three different years. These CSV files have three columns, where the first column contains dates, the second column shows whether the day was working or not, and the third column shows whether the day was classified as high or low activity period. High activity period corresponds to days when the academic semester was going on, and students were in campus dormitories. Semester breaks, summer and winter breaks, and festival breaks of several consecutive days during the semesters were considered as low activity period. 

Sub-directory ‘weather’ contains three CSV files corresponding to three different years. These CSVs have three columns corresponding to timestamp, temperature and humidity.
